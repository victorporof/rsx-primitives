Most operations in this library only support inputs of type `Image`, rather than arbitrary `image::GenericImage`s. This is obviously less flexible, but has the advantage of allowing many functions to be more performant. We may want to add more flexibility later, but this should not be at the expense of performance. When specialisation lands we should be able to do this by defining traits for images with contiguous storage."]]});
